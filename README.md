_I am taking my first steps in the world of programming._ ğŸš€
Previously I studied chemical engineering and just a few months after finishing my degree I decided to be true to myself, find a path towards a job that respects the way I have chosen to continue my life.

I am a person open to continue learning what is necessary, to adapt to new or unknown terrain ğŸŒ± and delighted to bring _joy and energy!_ âš¡

Nice to meet you! I hope nice things come out of our meeting. ğŸ˜„
