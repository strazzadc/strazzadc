### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Deborah Strazza

_I am taking my first steps in the world of programming. Previously I studied chemical engineering and just a few months after finishing my degree I decided to be true to myself, find a path towards a job that respects the way I have chosen to continue my life.

_Nice to meet you! I hope nice things come out of our meeting :)
